        <p>
          This is a dummy application, which is showing my skills, and all api
          calls inside this are mocked apis , because right now I am working as
          a frontend developer. so i can only show you data comming from call. i
          have used react, react-router, redux, redux, material ui, formik, yup,
          and many more libraries. i am working to upgrade this app to a full
          stack application, so that i can show you my backend skills as well.
